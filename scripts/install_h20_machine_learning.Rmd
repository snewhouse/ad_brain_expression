# The following two commands remove any previously installed H2O packages for R.
if ("package:h2o" %in% search()) { detach("package:h2o", unload=TRUE) }
if ("h2o" %in% rownames(installed.packages())) { remove.packages("h2o") }

# Next, we download, install and initialize the H2O package for R.
install.packages("h2o", repos=(c("http://h2o-release.s3.amazonaws.com/h2o/rel-noether/1/R", getOption("repos"))))

# Finally, let's run a demo to see H2O at work.

R is connected to H2O cluster:
    H2O cluster uptime:         2 seconds 323 milliseconds 
    H2O cluster version:        2.8.4.1 
    H2O cluster name:           H2O_started_from_R 
    H2O cluster total nodes:    1 
    H2O cluster total memory:   6.97 GB 
    H2O cluster total cores:    8 
    H2O cluster allowed cores:  2 
    H2O cluster healthy:        TRUE 

Note:  As started, H2O is limited to the CRAN default of 2 CPUs.
       Shut down and restart H2O as shown below to use all your CPUs.
           > h2o.shutdown(localH2O)
           > localH2O = h2o.init(nthreads = -1)
